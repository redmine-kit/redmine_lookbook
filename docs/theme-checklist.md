# Theme checklist

What a Redmine 7 theme has to handle, and the previews to check each item with. The previews are named as in Lookbook's navigation (see the [preview list](previews.md)). For how Redmine applies a theme, see [Redmine 7 themes](themes.md).

Check each item with the toolbar's defaults first, then with:

- the "Redmine layout" option, for the header, the menus and the sidebar,
- a right-to-left language (Arabic, Persian or Hebrew),
- a language with long words (for example German) and a language with other scripts (for example Japanese),
- a narrow preview pane (below 900 pixels wide), for `responsive.css`.

## Not covered by the previews

Check these in a Redmine of your own:

- **States after JavaScript:** page previews are opened with a GET request and show pages as they first appear. The "Menus" previews show the menus open, but autocomplete lists (issues, wiki pages and mentions), drag and drop, and forms after they are sent are not shown.
- **Hover and focus:** check them by pointing at and tabbing through the previews.
- **Other users:** most page previews render as an administrator, who sees every link. Some render as `jsmith` (for example "Project overview as a member" and "Issue as a member"), `dlopper` ("Forbidden (403)") or an anonymous user (the signed-out pages). Check the pages that matter for your users with a user of their role.
- **Private notes:** Redmine's test data has no private notes.
- **Settings that change pages:** for example Gravatar, the text area font of a user, table sorting in wiki pages and disabled reactions. The previews use the settings of the test data, except where the preview list gives settings in "Notes". Your own previews can set others (see [Writing previews](writing-previews.md#settings-for-one-preview)).
- **Plugins:** pages and stylesheets of plugins. Add [your own previews](writing-previews.md) for them.
- **Emails, PDF and CSV exports, and Atom feeds:** themes do not apply to them.
